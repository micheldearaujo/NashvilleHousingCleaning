# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

Hi there! In this project I will go through a data cleaning in the "Nashville Housing" dataset
 
<hr>
  </div>

#### Let's get right into it! In this dataset I intend to make some data cleaning, for example

1. Standardize the date format
2. Fill in the NULL values in the Property Address column
3. Separate the Property Address and the Owner Address
4. Change the Y and N to Yes and No in the Sold as Vacant column
5. Remove duplicates
6. Delete unused column
