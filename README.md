# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

Hi there! In this project I will go through a data cleaning in the "Nashville Housing" dataset
 
<hr>
  </div>

-- Let's get right into it! In this dataset I intend to make some data cleaning, for example

-- Standardize the date format
-- Fill in the NULL values in the Property Address column
-- Separate the Property Address and the Owner Address
-- Change the Y and N to Yes and No in the Sold as Vacant column
-- Remove duplicates
-- Delete unused column
